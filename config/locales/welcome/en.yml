    introduction: >
      This page is intended to help those fencers who are starting and have no one to consult
      in the middle of an assault. When someone gets into this sport and decides to compete
      with some basic knowledge of the tactical scheme to follow, which costs years of experience
      to achieve, it is very difficult to decide which actions to carry out. These decisions are
      more difficult to take in the assault since you have the adrenaline of the moment,
      which although you have many years of experience, will not allow you to think with a
      cold mind. Thanks to this tool we can have support to make decisions in a more appropriate
      way. This will give us options that perhaps we did not take into account, giving us a
      reasoning why we should consider them for our tactics in the assault. It will also provide
      us with those ideas which it does not consider opportune, as before, giving us the
      theoretical motives of why it is not a good idea to carry out such actions.

      This tool does not only serve to help us in the middle of a competition, it will also
      serve as a reference in training or whenever we have doubts about which situations it
      is better to do one thing or another.
    ways_to_use: >
      For this, this tool has two modes. The first one will be a form to fill in which we will
      have to introduce the characteristics of the shooters that face. Once we have completed
      the form correctly, that is, we have filled in all the required fields, we can see the
      results of the system. On the other hand we will have the guided version of the system,
      which is more thought to use it "in action". In this case, the tool will ask us a series
      of questions which will be easier to answer since most of them will be yes, no or I do not
      know. Once we have finished the battery of questions as in the previous model we will get
      the result of the system.
