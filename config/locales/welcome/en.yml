    introduction1: >
      This page is intended to help those fencers who are starting
      and they have no one to consult in the middle of an assault.

    introduction2: >
      When someone gets into this sport and decides to compete with some knowledge
      Basic tactical scheme to follow, it takes years of experience to get and a lot
      Decide what actions to carry out. These decisions are more difficult to make in
      the assault since you have the adrenaline of the moment, and although you have been many years
      of experience, it does not allow you to think with a cold mind.

    introduction3: >
      Thanks to this tool we can have support to make the decisions of
      A more appropriate way. We give ourselves options that we may not consider, giving us
      a reasoning why we should consider them for our tactics in the assault.
      It will also provide us with ideas that you do not consider appropriate, as before,
      giving us the theoretical reasons why it is not a good idea to carry out different actions.

    using_moments: >
      This tool is not only to help us in the middle of a competition, but also
      It will serve as a reference in training or at any time
      Let us have doubts about which situations it is better to do one thing or another.

    ways_to_use: >
      This tool has two modes.

    way_1: >
      1. A form to fill out, where we must introduce the characteristics of the
      shooters that face. Once we have filled out the form correctly,
      We can see the results of the system.

    way_2: >
      2. Guided version of the system, designed to be used "in action". In this case the
      tool will ask us a series of questions, most will be yes, no or
      I do not know. Once we have finished the battery of questions as in the model
      Previous we will get the result of the system.
